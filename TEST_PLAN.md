# SauceDemo Test Automation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

**Project:** SauceDemo E-commerce Test Automation  
**Application:** https://www.saucedemo.com  
**Timeline:** 2–3 weeks  
**Team:** QA Automation Engineer  

### Purpose
Create test automation framework for SauceDemo application. Need to build something scalable that can catch bugs before they reach production and support our CI/CD pipeline.

### Business Goals
- Make sure core e-commerce features work properly
- Catch breaking changes early 
- Automate testing for faster releases
- Reduce manual testing by ~80%

## 2. Application Analysis

### What we're testing
- Web application built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Form-based login system
- Main features: product catalog, shopping cart, checkout

### User Types
Based on initial exploration, found 4 different user types:
- **standard_user** - normal user, full access
- **locked_out_user** - blocked user (good for negative testing)
- **problem_user** - has some UI issues
- **performance_glitch_user** - slower responses

### Key User Flows
1. Login → Browse products
2. Add items to cart → View cart
3. Checkout → Complete purchase
4. Error scenarios and recovery

## 3. Test Strategy

### Approach
Planning to use test pyramid approach - focus on critical E2E flows but also have good coverage at integration level.

```
    /\     E2E Tests (~20%)
   /  \    Integration Tests (~30%)  
  /____\   Unit Tests (~50%)
```

### Test Categories

**Smoke Tests** - most critical stuff, should run fast (under 2 min)
- Basic login/logout
- Add item to cart
- Complete purchase flow

**Regression Tests** - broader coverage, can take up to 10 minutes
- All user types
- Different product combinations
- Form validations

**Negative Tests** - error scenarios
- Invalid login attempts
- Empty cart checkout
- Missing form fields

### What's In Scope
- User authentication (all 4 user types)
- Product browsing and selection
- Shopping cart operations
- Checkout process and form validation
- Error message handling
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari support

### What's Out of Scope
- Performance testing (separate project)
- Security testing
- Mobile testing (maybe Phase 2)
- API testing (backend team handles this)
- Database testing

## 4. Technical Approach

### Technology Stack
After some research, decided on:

**Core Framework:**
- Python 3.11+ (team knows it well)
- pytest (good fixture support, flexible)
- Playwright (faster than Selenium, better API)

**Supporting Tools:**
- Allure for reporting (looks professional)
- pytest-html for quick reports
- Loguru for logging (cleaner than standard logging)
- YAML for config (easier to read than JSON)
- Pydantic for data validation

**Why these choices:**
- Playwright is newer and more reliable than Selenium
- pytest fixtures are really powerful for test setup
- Python because that's what we know best

### Design Pattern
Going with Page Object Model - keeps tests clean and maintainable.

```
pages/
├── base_page.py          # common stuff
├── login_page.py         
├── inventory_page.py     
├── cart_page.py          
└── checkout_page.py      
```

```
tests/
├── test_login.py         
├── test_shopping.py      
└── test_checkout.py      
```

### Environment Setup
Need:
- Python 3.11+
- Virtual environment
- Chrome/Firefox/Safari browsers
- IDE (PyCharm or VS Code)

For CI/CD thinking GitHub Actions since it's free and integrates well.

## 5. Test Cases

### Priority Test Scenarios

| Feature  | Happy Path            | Negative Cases              | Edge Cases       | Priority |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|----------|
| Login    | Valid users (4 types) | Wrong password, locked user | Empty fields     | Critical |
| Shopping | Browse, add to cart   | Invalid products            | Large quantities | High     |
| Cart     | Add/remove items      | Unavailable items           | Cart limits      | Critical |
| Checkout | Complete purchase     | Missing info                | Invalid data     | Critical |

### Main Test Cases

**TC001: Login Flow**
- Go to login page
- Try each user type with valid credentials
- Verify successful login and redirect
- Should work for all 4 user types

**TC002: Shopping Cart**
- Login as standard user
- Add a few products to cart
- Check cart badge updates correctly
- Go to cart page and verify items
- Remove one item and verify update

**TC003: Checkout Process**
- Have items in cart
- Go through checkout steps
- Fill customer information
- Complete purchase
- Verify confirmation page

### Test Data Strategy
Planning to use parametrized tests for different data combinations:
- Login credentials (valid/invalid)
- User types (4 different ones)
- Checkout data (different formats, international)
- Product combinations

Will store test data in YAML files and use fixtures for setup.

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (Week 1) - Foundation
- Set up project structure
- Create base page classes
- Implement basic page objects (login, inventory)
- Get 3-5 smoke tests working
- Set up CI pipeline

### Phase 2 (Week 2) - Core Features  
- Complete all page objects
- Build comprehensive test suite (targeting 15-20 tests)
- Add data-driven testing
- Integrate reporting (HTML + Allure)
- Cross-browser testing

### Phase 3 (Week 3) - Polish
- Add edge cases and negative scenarios
- Optimize for parallel execution
- Documentation and cleanup
- Production deployment

### Checkpoints
**End of Week 1:** Smoke tests passing, basic framework ready

**End of Week 2:** Full test suite working, reports integrated

**Final:** All requirements met, documentation complete

## 7. Quality and Reliability

### Code Standards
- Use type hints where it makes sense
- Add docstrings for main functions
- Proper error handling
- Good logging for debugging

### Making Tests Reliable
- Use proper waits (no hard sleeps)
- Keep tests independent
- Add retry logic for flaky network issues
- Take screenshots when tests fail

### Maintenance
- Use data-test attributes when possible
- Keep configuration external
- Make components reusable
- Use meaningful commit messages

## 8. Success Criteria

### Technical Goals
- Cover >90% of critical user paths
- Full test suite runs in <5 minutes
- Less than 5% false failures
- Easy to add new tests (under 2 hours)

### Business Goals
- Catch 80% of bugs before production
- Reduce manual testing time by 75%
- Enable daily releases with confidence
- Positive ROI within 3 months

### Quality Gates
- All smoke tests must pass for deployment
- No critical bugs in test results
- 95% success rate over a week
- Test suite response time <5 minutes

## 9. Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **UI changes breaking tests** - Use stable selectors, plan for maintenance
- **Flaky tests in CI** - Add retry logic, improve waits
- **Browser issues** - Test on multiple browsers, have fallbacks
- **Test data problems** - Use isolated data, cleanup after tests

### Project Risks
- **Timeline pressure** - Start with MVP, add features incrementally
- **Scope creep** - Keep scope clear, document any changes
- **Knowledge gaps** - Document everything, share knowledge

## 10. Next Steps

1. Get approval for this plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Start Phase 1 implementation
4. Regular check-ins with stakeholders

## 11. Success Metrics

Want to track:
- Test execution time
- Pass/fail rates
- Bug detection rate
- Time saved vs manual testing
- Framework adoption

## 12. Final Notes

This plan focuses on building a solid foundation first, then expanding. Better to have fewer tests that work reliably than many flaky ones.

The framework should be easy to extend when new features are added to the application. Planning for maintainability from the start.
